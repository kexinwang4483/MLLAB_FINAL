# News popularity analysis and prediction


With the expansion of the Internet, more and more people enjoys reading and sharing online news articles. The number of shares under a news article indicates how popular the news is. In this project, I intend to find the best model and set of feature to predict the popularity of online news, using machine learning techniques.

My dataset has 39644 rows, 61 columns and the last column share is my target variable. I plan to first decide the threshold and convert it to 2 classes, which would be popular and not popular, so my project is actually a binary classification problem. The analytic goals include:

1. Convert the target variable to binary format.
2. Preprocess the data appropriately.
3. Fit model for binary classification and check the performance.
4. Find the best model with grid search and randomized search.
5. Make conclusions.
